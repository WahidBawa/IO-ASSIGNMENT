Reading and writing to files is very similar to printing to the screen and reading 
from the keyboard.  There are a few reasons why using files is essential.

1. Can save permanent results from your program.  Values in variables and pictures on the screen 
only last as long as the program runs. Writing files to the hard drive allows you to save the 
results of your program permanently.

2. Easier to test your program from file to make sure it is correct (rather than typing in 
50-100 pieces of data each time.)

3. Outputting to a file makes it easy to use the results in another application. We can open 
the output of our Python program in Excel so we can add a nice graph. We can write HTML code 
from our Python program and open it in a browser. We can even write output from one Python program 
that acts as input to another python program.

4. Reading data files allows us to easily add vast amounts of information to our programs. 
You want all of the movies that ever won an Oscar, all of the Governor Generals of Canada, 
or The Complete Works of William Shakespeare, all are very easy to find on the Internet.  
Once you have the raw data in a file it is fairly easy to extract the information you need for 
your program.

5. Separation of Data from Algorithm. If you type in your data at the beginning of your program, 
then your program will only work for that data. If you read in your data from a file then you can 
easily change the file and now your program will work for the new data.
Suppose I have a program that reads in every student's name and course requests for the next school 
year. The data will change every year, but the program shouldn't. This also means that I can give my 
program to others and they can use it just by changing the data file.
